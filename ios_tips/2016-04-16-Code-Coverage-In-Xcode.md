tip-description: Code coverage is a feature in Xcode 7 that enables you to visualize and measure how much of your code is being exercised by tests. With code coverage, you can determine whether your tests are doing the job you intended.

####Note:
Code coverage data collection incurs a performance penalty. Whether the penalty is significant or not, it should affect execution of the code in a linear fashion so performance results remain comparable from test run to test run when it is enabled. However, you should consider whether to have code coverage enabled when you are critically evaluating the performance of routines in your tests.
